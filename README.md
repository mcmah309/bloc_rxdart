# bloc_subject

`bloc_subject` is a Dart package that introduces the `BlocSubject` class, a combination of RxDart's `BehaviorSubject` with the powerful `BLoC` (Business Logic Component) pattern. It allows you to handle events and state changes in a reactive way, leveraging RxDart's stream manipulation capabilities while maintaining state and responding to events asynchronously.
